                        A hybrid Game Developer and Designer with over three years of experience specializing in mobile
                        Action-Roguelike games. I architect engaging gameplay—from intricate skill systems to
                        challenging AI—while writing the clean, optimized code required to guarantee a stable 60-FPS
                        experience. My skillset extends into the 3D pipeline with a working knowledge of Unity VFX,
                        shaders, and humanoid rigging in Maya. This dual expertise allows me to build features that are
                        both creatively ambitious and technically robust from their inception.

                        <h4>Development Deep Dive</h4>
                        <p>This project was a comprehensive overhaul of a pre-existing title, with the core mission of
                            transforming it with a new thematic identity and significantly enhanced gameplay systems to
                            boost long-term player retention. My role was central to this evolution, spanning the full
                            spectrum of both technical engineering and creative design.</p>
                        <p>From a design perspective, my focus was on architecting a scalable character skill system
                            that allowed for deep strategic variety. I designed and balanced the core mechanics, stats,
                            and synergistic interactions for all new character skills. A significant part of this
                            process involved overhauling the AI for all mobs and bosses, implementing varied attack
                            patterns, movement logic, and decision-making heuristics to create more dynamic,
                            unpredictable, and challenging encounters. I also meticulously balanced the in-game economy
                            by tuning resource drops and difficulty curves across multiple chapters to ensure a fair yet
                            rewarding player progression.</p>
                        <p>Technically, a primary challenge was delivering high-fidelity visuals on a wide range of
                            mobile devices. The new, visually rich VFX for character skills caused significant
                            performance drops during intense combat scenes. Instead of constantly instantiating and
                            destroying particle effects—a costly operation that causes garbage collection spikes and
                            stuttering—I engineered a robust <strong>object pooling system</strong>. This resulted in a
                            dramatically smoother gameplay experience, maintaining a stable 60 FPS even when hundreds of
                            particles were on-screen. This project taught me the critical importance of performance
                            profiling early and often, solidifying a "performance-by-design" mindset that I now apply to
                            all my work.</p>

                            clear the screen of enemies.</p>

                        <h4>Development Deep Dive</h4>
                        <p>The mission for Heroes Survivor was to create a compelling and visually satisfying title
                            within the popular "bullet heaven" survival genre, focusing on high replayability and a
                            strong sense of power progression. My role was to design the core combat experience and
                            ensure the game could technically handle the on-screen chaos inherent to the genre.</p>
                        <p>From a design perspective, I focused on creating unique character skills that would be
                            effective and satisfying in an auto-firing combat system. A significant part of my
                            responsibility was the design and balancing of the monster wave system; I meticulously
                            scripted the timing, composition, and intensity of enemy swarms to build a dynamic
                            difficulty curve that was both challenging and fair. I also designed and fine-tuned the
                            behaviors for all bosses to make them memorable encounters that tested the player's build
                            and skills.</p>
                        <p>The primary technical hurdle for this genre is maintaining smooth performance while rendering
                            hundreds of independent enemies and projectiles simultaneously. My solution was to implement
                            a comprehensive optimization strategy centered around object pooling for not just VFX, but
                            also for enemies and loot drops. I also optimized the AI calculation loop to reduce its
                            performance cost when scaled up to hundreds of agents. This technical foundation was
                            critical to delivering a fluid, lag-free experience, even during the most chaotic late-game
                            moments.</p>

                        <h4>Development Deep Dive</h4>
                        <p>As the original flagship title, the mission for Archer Hunter was to create a highly engaging
                            and scalable roguelike experience from the ground up, built around an addictive core combat
                            loop. My role was foundational, involving the architecture of core gameplay systems and
                            establishing the technical groundwork to ensure a smooth, high-quality player experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>From a design perspective, I was responsible for architecting the game’s core systems. This
                            began with designing a versatile character skill system that allowed for dynamic,
                            procedurally-generated builds in each run. I developed the initial AI for a wide range of
                            enemies, creating the fundamental behavior patterns that defined the game's challenge.
                            Furthermore, I conceptualized the Player vs. Player (PVP) mode and the In-App Purchase (IAP)
                            model, laying the groundwork for the game's long-term engagement and monetization
                            strategies.</p>
                        <p>Technically, our primary goal was to deliver high-fidelity visuals and effects on a wide
                            range of mobile devices without compromising performance. The visually-intensive VFX for
                            character skills presented a significant performance hurdle. To solve this proactively, I
                            engineered a robust <strong>object pooling system</strong> as a core part of our
                            architecture. Instead of constantly creating and destroying costly particle effects, this
                            system recycled them efficiently. This foundational decision ensured we could maintain a
                            stable 60 FPS during heavy combat, establishing a "performance-by-design" philosophy for the
                            project from day one.</p>

                        <h4>Development Deep Dive</h4>
                        <p>For this project, I took on the role of Lead Designer, responsible for architecting the
                            entire player experience from concept to execution. The mission was to create a deeply
                            engaging Hero Tower Defense game with extensive long-term retention systems, setting it
                            apart through strategic depth and a rewarding progression loop.</p>
                        <p>From a design perspective, I drove the vision for all core gameplay systems. This included
                            designing the main character's talent tree, the skills for all sub-generals, and the
                            intricate equipment system, complete with a gem socketing mechanic for deep customization. I
                            designed the entire game economy, from the IAP store structure to the reward loops for
                            chapter progression and map clears. A significant portion of my time was dedicated to
                            meticulously balancing these interconnected systems to ensure a fair, challenging, and
                            satisfying difficulty curve for players.</p>
                        <p>From a technical standpoint, I continued to contribute as a hands-on developer. I programmed
                            complex AI behaviors for enemy waves and unique bosses to bring my design vision to life. I
                            also created a majority of the game's captivating VFX and was responsible for performance
                            optimization, ensuring that the game could handle numerous 3D units and effects smoothly on
                            a wide range of mobile devices. This project represents my growth into a leadership role,
                            guiding the game's overall design while still directly contributing to its technical
                            implementation.</p>
